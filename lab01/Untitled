My name is Chris Eheler
My major is Computer Programming
My experience programming is very minimal, I spent a little time when I was younger doing python and played around on code academy.
Anything else I would like to share with the class? Nope, if you have a question ask, I will help if I can or we can struggle together. I am a very approachable person.
